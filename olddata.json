It seeks to lead a revolutionary, mass-based movement to oust the Philippine government. The ABB was originally established on April 6, 1986 to serve as the CPP-NPA\u2019s guerilla force in Manila. ABB attacks killed more than two hundred people, including government employees and business owners, between the group\u2019s establishment and its split from the CPP-NPA. In the early 1990s, after a major rift within the CPP-NPA over tactics and ideology, the ABB left its parent organization. In 1997, it allied with the Revolutionary Proletarian Army (RPA), another CPP-NPA splinter group, and formed a political wing called Rebolusyonaryong Partido ng Manggagawa ng Pilipinas (RPM-P). In December 2000, the RPM-P signed a peace agreement with the Philippine government, and it has put forward candidates for elected office. The ABB, in collaboration with the RPA, continues to operate as the RPM-P\u2019s militant wing, although it claims to operate as a self-defense force and to prioritize mass-based politics over armed struggle. The U.S. State Department has included the ABB on its Terrorist Exclusion List since December 2001.",

During his term as ARMM governor, between 1996 and 2001, Misuari was heavily criticized for political and financial mismanagement by government officials and MNLF members, leading to the formation of factions like Muslimin Sema\u2019s Executive Council of 15 (EC-15). After the 2013 Zamboanga City Crisis and warrant for his arrest, Misuari has been in hiding. However, he continues to hold an influential position among some of the factions, three of which chose him in 2014 as their representative for any future talks with the government. He strongly opposes MILF-Philippine government talks.",

The JIM seeks to establish an independent state in the southern Philippines governed by Shariah law and exclusively for Filipino Muslims. The group was founded by Mohammad Ali Tambako, who had previously served as the BIFF\u2019s leader, after he left or was ousted from the BIFF in 2013 for conducting an attack on a Christian community. However, Tambako and the BIFF seemingly reconciled soon after the JIM\u2019s establishment, and in 2015, the JIM and the BIFF formally allied themselves to fight against the Philippine government. ",
